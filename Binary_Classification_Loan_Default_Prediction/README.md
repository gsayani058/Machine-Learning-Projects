## **Overview**
This project focuses on predicting loan defaults using binary classification models. It aims to provide insights into customer risk profiles, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions. The project tackles challenges such as data imbalance and feature selection to improve model accuracy and reliability.

## **Features**
- Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between variables.
- Handle class imbalance using techniques like under-sampling, over-sampling, or SMOTE.
- Train various binary classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluate models using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
