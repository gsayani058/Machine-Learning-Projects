## **Overview**
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The project addresses the challenges of imbalanced datasets by implementing both under-sampling and over-sampling techniques. It evaluates the performance of various classification models to identify the most effective approach for detecting fraud.

## **Features**
- Perform data cleaning to handle missing and duplicate values.
- Analyze and visualize data to identify patterns (EDA).
- Assess class imbalance and its impact on model performance.
- Train models on raw, under-sampled, and over-sampled datasets.
- Evaluate models using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Use hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
