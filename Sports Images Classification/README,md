## Overview
This project involves building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify sports images into their respective categories. The dataset contains images of various sports, categorized into 22 classes. The project demonstrates a complete workflow, including data exploration, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation, to achieve accurate classification.

## Key Features
- **Dataset Handling**: Loaded and processed a dataset of sports images, containing 22 categories such as football, cricket, basketball, and more.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Resized images to a uniform size of (200, 200) and encoded labels for training.
- **Model Architecture**: Built a CNN model with:
  - Two convolutional layers with max pooling.
  - Dense layers for feature extraction.
  - Dropout layers for regularization.
- **Training**: Trained the model with a training-validation split, achieving an accuracy of **91.58%** on the training set.
- **Evaluation**: Validated the model on a test dataset and analyzed the accuracy and loss over epochs.
- **Future Scope**: The model could be further improved by fine-tuning hyperparameters, using transfer learning, or experimenting with advanced architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet.
