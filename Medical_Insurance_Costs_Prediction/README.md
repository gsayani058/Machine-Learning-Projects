Project Overview
This project aims to predict the cost of medical insurance for individuals based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of dependents, smoking habits, and region. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models, the project identifies the most significant factors influencing insurance costs and builds an accurate prediction model.

Features
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
Handle missing and duplicate values for data cleaning.
Feature engineering and selection to identify the most relevant factors for prediction.
Train multiple regression models and evaluate their performance.
Use hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model parameters.
Provide a final model that accurately predicts insurance costs based on user input.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RÂ² score.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Libraries:
NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
